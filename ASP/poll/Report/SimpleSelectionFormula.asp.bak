' INSTANTIATE THE REPORT VIEWER
'
'When using the Crystal Reports in an ASP environment, we use
'the same page-on-demand Report Viewers used with the Crystal Web Component Server.
'There are six Report Viewers:
'
'1.  Report Viewer for ActiveX
'2.  Report Viewer for Java using Browser JVM
'3.  Report Viewer for Standard HTML with Frames
'4.  Report Viewer for Standard HTML
'5.  Report Viewer for Java Using Java Plugin
'6.  Report Viewer for Netscape Plug-in (ActiveX)
'
'The Report Viewer that you use will based on the browser's display capablities.
'For Example, you would not want to instantiate one of the Java viewers if the browser
'did not support Java applets.  For purposes on this demo, we have chosen to
'define a viewer.  You can through code determine the support capabilities of
'the requesting browser.  However that functionality is inherent in the Crystal
'Reports RDC and is beyond the scope of this demonstration application.
'
'We have chosen to leverage the server side include functionality of ASP
'for simplicity sake.  So you can use the SmartViewer*.asp files to instantiate
'the smart viewer that you wish to send to the browser.  Simply replace the line
'below with the Smart Viewer asp file you wish to use.
'
'The choices are SmartViewerActiveX.asp, SmartViewerJava.asp, JavaPluginViewer.asp,
'ActiveXPluginViewer.asp. SmartViewerHTMLFrame.asp, and SmartViewerHTMLPAge.asp.
'Note that to use this include you must have the appropriate .asp file in the 
'same virtual directory as the main ASP page.
'
'*NOTE* For SmartViewerHTMLFrame and SmartViewerHTMLPage, you must also have
'the files framepage.asp and toolbar.asp in your virtual directory.


'=============================================================================
'  DISPLAY THE REPORT
'   - display the report using a smart viewer
' 
' Include one of the Smart Viewers.
'  - Report Viewer for ActiveX			=   SmartViewerActiveX.asp
'  - Report Viewer for Java using Browser JVM	=   SmartViewerJAVA.asp
'  - Report Viewer for Standard HTML		=   SmartViewerHTMLPage.asp
'  - Report Viewer for Standard HTML w/ Frames	=   SmartViewerHTMLFrame.asp
'  - Report Viewer for Java Using Java Plugin	=   JavaPluginViewer.asp
'  - Report Viewer for Netscape Plug-in		=   ActiveXPluginViewer.asp
